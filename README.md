# LAST_Handle

The Mother of all LAST classes. It inerits from the Matlab class `handle`, and supplements it with
utility methods, for example to handle configurations.

All drivers and abstractors inherit from it.

This package depends on:

+ **LAST_config** for the configuration part; that in turn depends on **MAAT**
